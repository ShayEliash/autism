        <h1>10 Wonderful Things You Didn't Know About Autism</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">As Described by Autistic People</p>
        <p class="intro">💙 Hi, I’m Shay – a father to an autistic child.<br><br>

            I’m not a professional.
            I’m not a neuroscientist, not a keynote speaker, and I don’t pretend to know everything.
            But I am a person with a big heart.
            And more than anything – I’m a father. A proud father to a wonderful child,
            for whom the word “autism” is just a small doorway into an entire universe.<br><br>

            When we first entered this world – of diagnoses, therapies, and new terminology –
            I searched for answers.
            But more than anything, I was searching for a voice.
            A voice that speaks from the heart, with honesty. A voice from autistic people themselves.<br><br>

            And here’s what I discovered:
            It’s not a malfunction – it’s a form of diversity.
            It’s not emotional detachment – but a depth that often transcends words.
            And it’s not a path that needs to be corrected – it’s a path that needs to be understood.<br><br>

            So I gathered here 10 remarkable truths about autism –
            but not ones that speak about autistic people.
            These are truths that speak from within the autistic experience.<br><br>

            Let’s learn to see differently.
            Let’s truly listen.<br><br>

            With love,
            Shay

            <h2>1. Autism is a unique way of experiencing the world – not a mistake to fix.</h2>
            <p>Autism is not a disease, defect, or deviation – it's a different kind of perception. Autistic minds
                operate in distinct neurological pathways, enabling deep, sharp, and curious ways of seeing. The world
                through their eyes is full of detail, patterns, depth, and wonder – just seen through a different lens.

            <img src="images/fact2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Think Differently" />
            <h2>2. They think differently – which opens up new worlds.</h2>
            <p>Autistic people often think through images, sounds, patterns, or bodily sensations – not always words.
                It's a layered, visual-sensory style of cognition, where ideas arrive as flashes, feelings, or pure
                perception.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Deep Emotions" />
            <h2>3. Emotions are deeply felt – sometimes too much.</h2>
            <p>Autistic people are not emotionless – quite the opposite. Many experience emotions with intensity and
                depth, which can lead to overwhelm and withdrawal. Beneath the surface lies a rich and tender emotional
                world.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact4.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Sensory World" />
            <h2>4. Sensory experiences vary – sometimes heightened, sometimes muted.</h2>
            <p>Some autistic people hear faint sounds like thunder or feel soft fabrics like sandpaper. Others need
                stronger input to register sensation. Their sensory world is vibrant, magical – and at times
                overwhelming.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact5.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Islands of Brilliance" />
            <h2>5. Special interests are islands of brilliance.</h2>
            <p>When autistic people dive into a topic, they do it wholeheartedly – learning, researching, creating.
                These aren’t obsessions – they’re sources of calm, mastery, and passion.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact6.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Authentic Communication" />
            <h2>6. Communication may look different – but it’s deep, honest, and precise.</h2>
            <p>Autistic communication might come through gestures, tone, drawing, writing, or even silence. When
                listened to with openness – it reveals presence, truth, and meaning.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact7.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Talents and Inventions" />
            <h2>7. Not “in spite of autism” – but also because of it.</h2>
            <p>Many autistic people are creators, inventors, artists, and thinkers. Their unique way of processing the
                world often gives rise to original insights and exceptional ideas.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact8.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="True Friendship" />
            <h2>8. Deep friendships are possible – just different.</h2>
            <p>Many autistic people long for connection, but prefer honesty, stillness, and simplicity. While they may
                miss social “codes,” their bonds – when formed – are authentic and heartfelt.</p>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact9.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Routine is Security" />
            <h2>9. Routine is an anchor of security.</h2>
            <p>Sudden changes or surprises can be destabilizing. Predictability, structure, and advance preparation help
                autistic individuals feel safe and flourish.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="fact">
            <img src="images/fact10.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Celebrate Neurodiversity" />
            <h2>10. Autism is neurodiversity – not a flaw, but part of humanity.</h2>
            <p>The world includes many kinds of minds and ways of being. Autistic people don’t need to change who they
                are – we all need to change how we understand and include them.</p>
